**Online Boutique** is a cloud-native microservices demo application that consists of a 10-tier microservices application. The application is a web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.

**We use this application to demonstrate the use of Cloud Native technologies like Kubernetes/GKE, Istio, AppDynamics and ThousandEyes**. This application works on any Kubernetes (k8s) cluster, as well as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

This project is based on the [original open-source microservices-demo from Google](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo).

# Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes.
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on _Istio_ service mesh.
- **[Kiali](https://kiali.io/):** Web-based graphical UI to view service graphs of the mesh, traffic topologies and _Istio_ configuration objects.
- **[AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/) for _App_ and _Cluster_ visibility:** The _FrontEnd_ service is versioned and
  instrumented with AppDynamics for [application performance monitoring](https://www.appdynamics.com/product/application-performance-monitoring). The k8s cluster is instrumented with AppDynamics [Cluster Agent](https://www.appdynamics.com/solutions/kubernetes-monitoring) to monitor the health of of the entire cluster, including every node and namespace down to the container level. [**GET YOUR APPDYNAMICS FREE TRIAL HERE**](https://www.appdynamics.com/free-trial/).
- **[ThousandEyes](https://www.thousandeyes.com/) for external Network visibility and end-user experience:** _ThousandEyes_
  [Browser Synthetics](https://www.thousandeyes.com/product/browser-synthetics) simulates users interacting with the application. ThousandEyes Cloud Agents were deployed, across the globe, to simulate these interactions and provide metrics, such as _availability_, _response time_, _latency_, _transaction times_, _errors_. [**GET YOUR THOUSANDEYES FREE TRIAL HERE**](https://www.thousandeyes.com/signup/).
- **[ThousandEyes & AppDynamics Integration](https://www.appdynamics.com/product/network-monitoring) for complete application service visibility:**
  ThousandEyes alerts are natively configured to trigger alerts in AppDynamics to correlate external network and user experience problems with internal application metrics. 
- **[Cloud Operations (Stackdriver)](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations):** Many services
  are instrumented with **Profiling**, **Tracing** and **Debugging**. In
  addition to these, using Istio enables features like Request/Response
  **Metrics** and **Context Graph** out of the box. When it is running out of
  Google Cloud, this code path remains inactive.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.


# Architecture

## Microservices
**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different languages that talk to each other over [_gRPC_](https://grpc.io/).

[![Architecture of
microservices](./docs/img/architecture-diagram.png)](./docs/img/architecture-diagram.png)

| Service                                              | Language      | Description                                                                                                                       |

## Kubernetes and Istio

The _Online Boutique_ is initially deployed in GKE with _Istio_, which defines the _Service Mesh_ and handles service-to-service communication. _Istio_  allows to decouple traffic management from application code by attaching a sidecar proxy (called envoy) next to each container that intercepts all incoming and outgoing communications. The interaction between all these proxies in the data plane, together with a common control plane, then creates the service mesh. This fundamentally helps you understand traffic flows among services and how to manage them with policies, protection and authentication. 

In this project, ingress resources like an _Istio_ `Gateway` and `VirtualService` are deployed to expose the _Online Boutique_ frontend running inside a Kubernetes cluster.

[![Kubernetes & Istio Diagram](./docs/img/k8s-istio-diagram.png)](./docs/img/k8s-istio-diagram.png)

[![ServiceMesh Architecture](./docs/img/ServiceMesh-Architecture.png)](./docs/img/ServiceMesh-Architecture.png)

## AppDynamics Agents
With _Istio_ at full steam we then focus on getting visibility into how the cluster and the application are performing. We start by using _Kiali_ which comes natively integrated with _Istio_ and provides visibility at the network service layer. We then implement _AppDynamics Agents_, at the infrastructure (i.e. cluster) and application layer.

### Cluster-Agent
This agent is deployed in its own _namespace_ and collects metrics and metadata for the entire cluster, including every node and namespace down to the container level, via the Kubernetes API. It then sends this information to the _AppDynamics_ controller.

[![Cluster Agent Diagram](./docs/img/cluster-agent-arch.png)](./docs/img/cluster-agent-arch.png)

The _AppDynamics cluster-agent_ also comes with an _auto-instrument_ feature, only available for _.NET_, _JAVA_ and _Node.js_. This dynamically and automatically adds the required application agents to the targeted applications. In essence, the _cluster agent_ modifies the application deployment by adding an _init_ container that installs the required _AppDynamics_ application agent on the application container when it automatically restarts. Both the _paymentservice_ & _currencyservice_ are _Node.js_ applications so the _AppDynamics cluster-agent_ automatically instruments them, as covered in the [Deployment section](https://github.com/JPedro2/Cloud-Native-Demo#cluster-agent-1). However, due to some _AppDynamics_ gRPC limitations the information of these are microservices is not being correlated at the _AppDynamics_ controller level. The goal is to solve this issue by building a gRPC middleware that allows the AppDynamics controller to correlate the information between the microservices.

[![Cluster Agent Auto-Instrument Diagram](./docs/img/cluster-agent-auto-instrumentation.png)](./docs/img/cluster-agent-auto-instrumentation.png)

### Application Performance Monitoring
At the moment, from an application perspective, only the _FrontEnd_ microservice is meaningfully instrumented with a _AppDynamics_ APM agent as this is the most used microservice. _Extending the AppDynamics APM agents to the remaining microservices is currently work-in-progress_.

## ThousandEyes
With _AppDynamics_ providing visibility at both the infrastructure and application layer, this is then augmented with _ThousandEyes Cloud Agents_ that provide **external visibility** from global vantage points (Cloud agents across 58 countries), the internet and browser synthetics. This provides an end-to-end view into the delivery of the _Online Boutique_ app to the user, whilst getting enhanced insights on the user experience.

The full architecture of the _Online Boutique_ application, with all the tools deployed, looks as follows.

# Deployment

## Prerequisites 
- [Docker for Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- A Google Cloud Project, [new]((https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project)) or existing with _Google Container Registry_ enabled
- The Google [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) installed, that includes the `gcloud` command-line tool
- `kubectl`, which can be installed via `gcloud components install kubectl`
- GCP APIs for Cloud Monitoring, Tracing, Debugger enabled:
```sh
gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com \
    cloudtrace.googleapis.com \
    clouddebugger.googleapis.com
```

## Quick-Start with GKE and Istio
1.  **Set the `PROJECT_ID` env variable and ensure the GKE API is enabled:**

    ```sh
    PROJECT_ID="<your-project-id>"
    gcloud services enable container --project ${PROJECT_ID}
    ```

    ```sh
    gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable cloudprofiler.googleapis.com
    ```
   
2.  **Enable _Google Container Registry (GCR)_ on your GCP project:**

    ```sh
    gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com
    ```
    Configure the `docker` CLI to authenticate to GCR:
    ```sh
    gcloud auth configure-docker -q
    ```

3.  **Clone this repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/JPedro2/Cloud-Native-Demo.git
    cd Cloud-Native-Demo
    ```

4.  **Create the GKE cluster:** 
    ```sh
    ZONE=europe-west2-a
    gcloud container clusters create <your-cluster-name> \
        --project=${PROJECT_ID} --zone=${ZONE} --cluster-version="1.16.15-gke.7800" \
        --enable-autoupgrade --enable-autoscaling \
        --min-nodes=4 --max-nodes=6 --machine-type=e2-standard-2
    ```
    Alternatively you can create a GKE cluster using the [Google Cloud UI](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-zonal-cluster#creating-a-cluster). If you do, please make sure that you **DO NOT** select the `Enable Istio` option under _Features_, as we will be installing _Istio_ manually in step 6.

    **Cost Saving Tip:** If you are using your personal GCP account for this demo **and** if you are planning on running it for a short period of time (<24h), you can use the `--preemptible` flag when creating the GKE cluster. [Preemptible VMs are Compute Engine VM instances that are priced lower, last a maximum of 24 hours in general, and provide no availability guarantees.](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/preemptible-vms)
    
    If you wish to do that please use the following to create your GKE cluster:

    ```sh
    ZONE=europe-west2-a
    gcloud container clusters create <your-cluster-name> \
        --project=${PROJECT_ID} --zone=${ZONE} --cluster-version="1.16.15-gke.7800" \
        --enable-autoupgrade --enable-autoscaling --preemptible \
        --min-nodes=4 --max-nodes=6 --machine-type=e2-standard-2
    ```

5.  **Point the `kubectl` context to the new GKE cluster:**
    ```sh
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --zone=${ZONE} --project=${PROJECT_ID}
    ```
    Alternatively you can get this command from the [GKE menu in the Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/) by clicking the _"Connect"_ button next to the k8s cluster that you just created.

    [![GKE Cluster Connect Button](./docs/img/gke-connect-button.png)](./docs/img/gke-connect-button.png)

    Use `kubectl` to confirm that you are pointing to that k8s cluster.
    ```sh
    kubectl config current-context
    ```

    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    Should output something like:
    ```sh
    NAME                                                  STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
    gke-boutique-appd-1key-boutique2-pool-8589b39d-9gm5   Ready    <none>   12m   v1.16.15-gke.6000
    gke-boutique-appd-1key-boutique2-pool-8589b39d-bm2y   Ready    <none>   12m   v1.16.15-gke.6000
    gke-boutique-appd-1key-boutique2-pool-8589b39d-cl2u   Ready    <none>   12m   v1.16.15-gke.6000
    gke-boutique-appd-1key-boutique2-pool-8589b39d-h3mr   Ready    <none>   12m   v1.16.15-gke.6000
    ```


6.  **Install [Istio](https://istio.io/) and add `istioctl` to your path:**
    ```sh
    curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=1.8.0 TARGET_ARCH=x86_64 sh -
    cd istio-1.8.0/
    export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
    istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
    cd ..
    ```
    **Please Note:** This uses _Istio v1.8.0_. If you  wish to install another version, such as the latest one, you will need to follow [Istio's Getting Started guide](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/).

7.  **Enable Istio sidecar proxy injection in the default k8s namespace**
    ```sh
    kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
    ```

8.  **Apply the k8s manifest that combines all of the microservices but the _Loadgenerator_**
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
    ```

9.  **Apply the Istio manifest that combines all the initial Istio configuration rules - _gateway_, _ingress_ and _egress_**
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f release/istio-manifests.yaml
    ```

10. **Get the Istio Ingress GW External IP Address:**
    ```sh
    kubectl -n istio-system get svc | grep "ingress"
    ```

11.  **Update the `loadgenerator.yaml.tplt` template k8s deployment with the _Istio Ingress GW IP Address_:**
     
     Go to the file `./kubernetes-manifests/loadgenerator.yaml.tplt` and update _line 37_ with the external IP address that you got from the previous step:
    
     ```YAML
     - name: FRONTEND_ADDR
       value: "<istio-ingressgateway-EXTERNAL-IP>:80"
     ```
     **After modifying the file and saving it make sure you rename it to `loadgenerator.yaml`.**

12.  **Apply the `loadgenerator.yaml` manifest:**
     ```sh
     kubectl apply -f kubernetes-manifests/loadgenerator.yaml
     ```

13. **Install Prometheus (optional), Grafana (optional) and Kiali as an Istio integration:**
     ```sh
     kubectl apply -f istio-1.8.0/samples/addons/prometheus.yaml
     kubectl apply -f istio-1.8.0/samples/addons/grafana.yaml
     kubectl apply -f istio-1.8.0/samples/addons/kiali.yaml
     ```

     **Please Note:** If you get a `no matches for kind "MonitoringDashboard"` error, just apply the `kiali.yaml` manifest again and the _monitoring dashboards_ should be created.

14. **Open the Kiali UI:** 
    ```sh
    istioctl dashboard kiali
    ```
    **This command ONLY works if you have `istioctl` in your `$PATH`. If you restarted your terminal or are using a different terminal tab, you will need to do the following:**
    ```sh
    cd istio-1.8.0/
    export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
    cd ..
    ```

    **OR alternatively**, you can also do it without `istioctl`, so that the session runs in the background:
    ```sh
    kubectl -n istio-system port-forward $(kubectl -n istio-system get pod -l app=kiali -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 20001:20001 &
    ```
    Once this is running you will need to open a browser session with `http://localhost:20001`.

    [![Kiali Dashboard Overview](./docs/img/kiali-dashboard-overview.png)](./docs/img/kiali-dashboard-overview.png)
    
    **Please Note:** If you use use option above you then need to kill the `port-forward`, after you are done with the _Kiali_ dashboard:
    ```sh
    killall kubectl
    ```

## Service-Mesh with Istio
_Istio_ allows you to decouple traffic management from application code, as well as helps you understand traffic flows between services. 
You can then, for example, define the percentage of traffic you want to send to a specific _canary_ version, or determine how to distribute traffic based on _source_/_destination_ or service version _weights_. This makes _A/B testing_, _gradual rollouts_ and _canary releases_ much easier to implement and manage.

Additionally, _Istio_ provides useful capabilities around [failure recovery to tolerate failing nodes or avoid cascading instabilities](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#working-with-your-applications), as well as [fault injection](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/fault-injection/) in the form of delays or connectivity failures, on specific requests to test application resiliency.

If you wish to experiment with some of these _Istio_ capabilities, you can `apply` some of the _Istio_ manifests in the [`/istio-manifests/routing`](./istio-manifests/routing) folder, and then with _Kiali_, visualise how the traffic flow changes. 

These _Istio_ manifests only focus on some specific traffic management use cases:
* Send traffic to different versions of a service based on source/destination, or service version weights. 
* Inject time delays at specific microservices
* Inject failures between microservices

**As an example** you may want to inject a 5 second delay on the _productcatalogservice_, to then evaluate how the other microservices behave and handle that scenario.

```sh
kubectl apply -f istio-manifests/routing/injection-delay.yaml 
```

Once this is deployed you can confirm it by going into your _Online Boutique_ `external IP address` in your browser and checking that when you click in one of the products on the _FrontEnd_ landing page, it takes at least 5 seconds to load. If you are using _Chrome_ you can re-do these steps whilst using the _inspect_ tool (`right-click > inspect > Network`).

[![Istio Injection-Delay Browser](./docs/img/injection-delay-browser.png)](./docs/img/injection-delay-browser.png)

You can also visualise this using _Kiali_, as shown.

[![Istio Injection-Delay Kiali](./docs/img/injection-delay-kiali.png)](./docs/img/injection-delay-kiali.png)

Once you've evaluated and analysed the fault, you will need to remove it so that your application goes back to normal.
```sh
kubectl delete -f istio-manifests/routing/injection-delay.yaml 
```

To deploy and explore the other _Istio_ manifests please check the [README in the `istio-manifests` folder](./istio-manifests).

**Please note** that the _FrontEnd-v2_ microservice is deployed in the [_AppDynamics_ section below](https://github.com/JPedro2/Cloud-Native-Demo#apm-agent).

## AppDynamics 

### Cluster Agent

The [AppDynamics Cluster Agent](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO45/Monitoring+Kubernetes+with+the+Cluster+Agent) used in this project is the `v20.10.0`. If you wish to use another version, or use a custom cluster agent image, you will need to build it and update the cluster agent manifest in `/AppD-Cluster-Agent-20.10/cluster-agent-operator.yaml`. For more info please check the [AppDynamics documentation on how to build the Cluster Agent Container Image](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO45/Build+the+Cluster+Agent+Container+Image).

To deploy the cluster agent we use the _AppDynamics Operator_, located in `/AppD-Cluster-Agent-20.10/cluster-agent-operator.yaml`.

1.  **Deploy _AppDynamics Operator_:**
    ```sh
    kubectl create namespace appdynamics
    kubectl create -f AppD-Cluster-Agent-20.10/cluster-agent-operator.yaml
    kubectl -n appdynamics get pods
    ```
    The output should be similar to the following:
    ```sh
    NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    appdynamics-operator-6d95b46d86-67pmp   1/1     Running   0          2m
    ```

2.  **Create a Controller Access Key Secret:**
    _AppDynamics_ agents need to connect to the controller to retrieve configuration data and send back information about the monitored environment. To find your controller `access-key` [please follow the 4 steps in this guide](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO21/Agent-to-Controller+Connections#Agent-to-ControllerConnections-findaccount) and then create a k8s secret as follows.

    ```sh
    kubectl -n appdynamics create secret generic cluster-agent-secret --from-literal=controller-key=<access-key>
    ```

3.  **Deploy the Cluster Agent:**
    Before running the _AppDynamics cluster-agent_ manifest you need to first rename the `cluster-agent.yaml.tplt` file to `cluster-agent.yaml` and then update it with your _AppDynamics Controller_ details. Check here [if you want more information on how to configure the cluster-agent yaml file](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO45/Configure+the+Cluster+Agent).
    * `appName` in _line 8_ - Name of the cluster that displays in the AppDynamics Controller UI as your cluster name.
    * `controllerUrl` in _line 9_ - Full AppDynamics Controller URL.
    * `account` in _line 10_ - AppDynamics account name.
    * `defaultAppName` in _line 28_ - Application name used by the agent to report to the Controller.
    
    In this particular demo we are using the _AppDynamics cluster-agent_ ability to [auto-instrument applications](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO21/Enable+Auto-Instrumentation+of+Supported+Applications). Since this feature only supports applications written in _.NET_, _JAVA_ and _Node.js_, this only applies to the _paymentservice_ & _currencyservice_ microservices. This feature is implemented in your `cluster-agent.yaml` manifest from line 25 onwards. You can comment or delete those lines if you don't want the _auto-instrument_ feature turned on.

    ```sh
    kubectl create -f AppD-Cluster-Agent-20.10/cluster-agent.yaml
    kubectl -n appdynamics get pods
    ```
    The output should be similar to the following:
    ```sh
    NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    appdynamics-operator-6d95b46d86-67pmp   1/1     Running   0          45m
    k8s-cluster-agent-79b6c95cb4-bdgzn      1/1     Running   0          1m30s
    ```

    **Please Note:** For debugging purposes, like if the controller doesn't receive data from the cluster agent, you can check the agent logs as follows:
    ```sh
    kubectl -n appdynamics logs <pod-name>
    ```
4. **Go to the AppDynamics Dashboard to visualise your cluster's monitoring data:**
   
   4.1. Open the _AppDynamics_ dashboard in your browser `https://<appdynamics-controller-host>/controller`

   4.2. Click the `Servers` tab at the top

   4.3. Click on the `Clusters` icon on the left-hand side

   4.4. You will see your _cluster name_, then select it and click the `Details` icon

   **Please Note:** Initially you may see _"No Data Available ⚠️"_ as you need to give some time for the agent to send enough data to the controller so that you can start seeing some cool graphs - usually around 15-30mins, aka coffee time ☕️.

The only microservice manually instrumented with _AppDynamics_ APM agent is the _FrontEnd_ microservice, written in `Golang`. _AppDynamics_ does not have an APM Agent, per se, for `GO`. Instead, we use the [AppDynamics GO SDK](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO45/Go+SDK), which in itself uses the `C++` SDK in the background. **For more deep and detailed information on how the _AppDynamics_ `GO` SDK is implemented in-line with the _FrontEnd_ code, you can check the the [README in src/frontend-v2-appD](./src/frontend-v2-appD).**

The goal is to deploy a _frontEnd_ version of the microservice that is instrumented with the _AppDynamics_ `GO` agent and not replace the existing non-instrumented one. For that we will deploy another _FrontEnd_ `v2` microservice, which is then added to the _Istio_ service mesh and allows us to perform some interesting _traffic management_ routines, like send traffic to either `v1` or `v2` based on version weights.

1. **Add AppDynamics Controller Settings to _frontEnd_ `v2` manifest:**
   Start by renaming the `frontend-v2.yaml.tplt` file to `frontend-v2.yaml`, located in the [`kubernetes-manifests` folder](./kubernetes-manifests).
   Add your AppDynamics controller details to the manifest, from _line 72_ to _line 81_.
   ```YAML
   - name: APPD_CONTROLLER_HOST
     value: "<appdynamics-controller-host>"
   - name: APPD_CONTROLLER_PORT
     value: "443"
   - name: APPD_CONTROLLER_USE_SSL
     value: "true"
   - name: APPD_CONTROLLER_ACCOUNT
     value: "<account-name>"
   - name: APPD_CONTROLLER_ACCESS_KEY
     value: "<access-key>"
   ```

2. **Deploy the AppD instrumented _frontEnd_ `v2` to the cluster:**
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes-manifests/frontend-v2.yaml
   ```
3. **Apply an _Istio_ destination rule that sets both _frontEnd_ microservices with `v1` and `v2` labels:**
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f istio-manifests/routing/destination-rule.yaml
   ```
4. **Delete the current `frontend-ingress` and apply a new one that routes traffic to _frontEnd_ `v1` and `v2` based on pre-selected weight:**
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f istio-manifests/routing/frontend-weighted-v1-v2.yaml
   kubectl delete virtualservice frontend-ingress
   ```
   **Please Note:** If you wish to experiment and change the weights, you can just modify the `weight` variables in _line 31_ and _37_ of the _Istio_ routing manifest `frontend-weighted-v1-v2.yaml` in the [`istio-manifests/routing` folder](./istio-manifests/routing) and then re-apply the manifest.
   Similarly to the section above, you can visualise how the traffic is flowing with this routing policy by looking at the _Kiali_ graph.

## ThousandEyes

### Cloud Agent - HTTP Server Tests
Currently in this project, ONLY [_ThousandEyes Cloud Agents_](https://www.thousandeyes.com/product/cloud-agents) are used. These provide an _External Vantage Point_ as they are globally distributed agents installed and managed by ThousandEyes in 190+ cities in 58 countries and immediately available.

Below is an example of how you can quickly create an `HTTP Server` test against the _Online Boutique_ frontEnd. This test can be performed as often as every minute and from several locations around the world. It provides you with insights on _Availability_, _Response Time_, _Throughput_ and you can even do a _Path Visualization_ to workout which routes is your application given out of GCP **OR**, most importantly, check if there is an issue in the network path, when the application performance starts degrading. 

[![TE HTTP Server Test](./docs/img/TE-HTTP-Server-Test.gif)](./docs/img/TE-HTTP-Server-Test.gif)

### Cloud Agent - HTTP Transaction Tests
Something far more exotic than `HTTP Server` tests are the `HTTP Transaction` tests that provide application experience insights with _Web Synthetics_. These types of tests measure entire multi-page workflows, with credential handling, simulating a complete user journey making sure those journeys complete successfully while providing an insight into the user experience. This allows for multi-layer correlation as you can now have transaction scripting tests with further information around _HTTP_, _Path Viz_, _BGP_ and _Internet Outages_.

To _write_ and _test_ transaction scripts _ThousandEyes_ provides a `ThousandEyes Recorder` application, that records your user journey through the application and builds the `Transaction Script` for you automatically - **no code expertise required**. All you have to do then is export that `Transaction Script` to your _ThousandEyes_ transaction test and run it - as before, as often as every minute and from several locations around the world.

**To fully utilise this feature I highly recommend that you watch [this short video tutorial](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/tests/getting-started-with-transactions)**. 

If you wish to test this out without building your own transaction test scripts, you can use the ones in the [ThousandEyes folder](./ThousandEyes). To do so, **make sure** that you add and *save* the `<Online-Boutique-IP-Address>` in _line 10_ of both files before you export them to _ThousandEyes_. Below is an example of how you can quickly deploy these transaction test scripts.

## ThousandEyes and AppDynamics Integration Integration

### Native Alerts
_ThousandEyes_ natively supports sending alert notifications directly to _AppDynamics_. This allows you to correlate trigger events with clear events, and to create policies in _AppDynamics_ based on specific properties like: _alertState_, _alertType_ (HTTP, Network, Voice, etc) and _testName_. In _AppDynamics_, _ThousandEyes_ alerts show up as custom events of type `ThousandEyesAlert` and allow you to open the _ThousandEyes_ app at the _Views_ screen for the alert start time to have further visibility into the issue.

[![TE AppD Integration Alerts](./docs/img/TE-AppD-Integration-Alerts.gif)](./docs/img/TE-AppD-Integration-Alerts.gif)

You can quickly and easily set-up the native alerts integration by following the steps in the official [ThousandEyes Documentation](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/alerts/integrations/appdynamics-integration).

### Custom Monitor

_ThousandEyes_ data can be pushed to the _AppDynamics_ controller via a _ThousandEyes Custom Monitor_, which is basically an [_AppDynamics_ Machine Agent extension](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO45/Extensions+and+Custom+Metrics) that pulls test data from the [_ThousandEyes_ API](https://developer.thousandeyes.com/), transforms the data payload, and pushes that data to the _AppDynamics_ controller via _custom metrics_. Currently the _ThousandEyes Custom Monitor_ only supports pulling metrics from _Page Load_, _HTTP/Web_ and _Network_ test types, unfortunately the _HTTP Transaction_ tests are not supported at the moment.

[![AppD TE CustomMonitor](./docs/img/AppD-TE-CustomMonitor.png)](./docs/img/AppD-TE-CustomMonitor.png)

This essentially allows to **correlate data from _ThousandEyes_ agents with data from _AppDynamics_ agents, which means comparing your Application Performance from the app layer (via the _AppDynamics_ APM agent) against the application experience from the user perspective (via the _ThousandEyes_ cloud agents)**. This provides powerful **insights** that can be then used both during production to proactively identify and mitigate sub-standard user-experience, as well as during development to understand how the user-experience may be impacted with the new upcoming features. 

In this demo there are two ways that you can deploy the _ThousandEyes Custom Monitor_:

1. Standalone docker container that can be deployed anywhere, such as your local machine or another VM in the Cloud or on-prem, since the _ThousandEyes Custom Monitor_ **does not** need to run in the same environment as the application. You will need to have both _Docker_ and _Compose_ [installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. A microservice running in the _K8s_ cluster that you've just created

**Please Note:** The _ThousandEyes Custom Monitor_ built in this demo derives from [this example](https://github.com/thousandeyes/appd-integration-reference/blob/master/custom-monitor/readme.md) and uses the _AppDynamics Standalone Machine Agent v21.2.0_ - the latest at the time of development. If you wish to use another version, you will need to build your own custom monitor by following the instructions [on the example](https://github.com/thousandeyes/appd-integration-reference/blob/master/custom-monitor/readme.md) and the [AppDynamics Machine Agent documentation](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO21/Standalone+Machine+Agent).
#### Deploying the _ThousandEyes Custom Monitor_ as a docker container
1. Set the _environment_ variables, used to link both your _AppDynamics_ and _ThousandEyes_ services, in the `configuration.env.tplt` file located in the [`AppD-TE-Custom-Monitor`](./AppD-TE-Custom-Monitor) folder. You will see line comments that explain which variables or credentials you need to use, most of them you have already used in previous parts of the demo.
2. Rename the _environment_ variable file from `configuration.env.tplt` to `configuration.env`.
3. Deploy the container using `docker-compose`
   ``` bash
   cd AppD-TE-Custom-Monitor/
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. Confirm that the _ThousandEyes Custom Monitor_ started successfully and it is running
   ``` bash
   docker ps -a
   ```
   The output should be similar to the following:
   ``` bash
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                     COMMAND                   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
   3a7f59fc56ba   peolivei/te-appd-custom-monitor:v21.2.0   "/bin/sh -c \"${MACHI…"   3 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds             te-appd-monitor
   ```
   You can also check the container _logs_:
   ``` bash
   docker logs te-appd-monitor
   ```

The container is running in `detach` mode. If you ever need to gracefully stop the _ThousandEyes Custom Monitor_ container and remove the volumes you need to make sure that you are in the `/Cloud-Native-Demo/AppD-TE-Custom-Monitor` directory and execute the following:
   ```
   docker-compose down -v
   ``` 
#### Deploying the _ThousandEyes Custom Monitor_ in the _K8s_ cluster
1. Edit the _environment_ variables, used to link both your _AppDynamics_ and _ThousandEyes_ services, in the `te-appd-custom-monitor.yaml.tplt` file, from _line 24_ to _line 75_, located in the [`AppD-TE-Custom-Monitor`](./AppD-TE-Custom-Monitor) folder. You will see line comments that explain which variables or credentials you need to use, most of them you have already used in previous parts of the demo.
2. Rename the _K8s_ manifest template file from `configuration.env.tplt` to `configuration.env`.
3. Deploy the to the _K8s_
   ``` bash
   kubectl apply -f AppD-TE-Custom-Monitor/te-appd-custom-monitor.yaml
   ```
   **Please Note:** The _ThousandEyes Custom Monitor_ is deployed in the `appdynamics` _namespace_.
4. Confirm that the _ThousandEyes Custom Monitor_ started successfully and it is running.
   ``` bash
   kubectl get pods -n appdynamics
   ```
   The output should be similar to the following:
   ``` bash
   NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   appdynamics-operator-6d95b46d86-49wzf           1/1     Running   0          28d
   k8s-cluster-agent-79b6c95cb4-z5st9              1/1     Running   0          28d
   te-appd-custom-monitor-agent-66c6db6b7f-6nb6c   1/1     Running   0          23h
   ```
   You can also check the pod _logs_:
   ``` bash
   kubectl -n appdynamics logs <pod-name>
   ```

#### Visualising the metrics

Once the _ThousandEyes Custom Monitor_ is running the metrics will appear under the _Application's metrics_ within the _Metric Browser_ on your _AppDynamics_ Dashboard. I would recommend initially giving it at least _15-30mins_ to give enough time for the controller to collect the data, also bear in mind that this depends on how frequently your _ThousandEyes_ Cloud agents tests are running.

[![MetricBrowser AppD-TE CustomMonitor](./docs/img/MetricBrowser-AppD-TE-CustomMonitor.gif)](./docs/img/MetricBrowser-AppD-TE-CustomMonitor.gif)

You can then get the `Average Response Time` from the _FrontEnd Business Transaction Metric_ coming directly from the _AppDynamics_ `GO` agent running in the `frontEnd` microservice and start correlating with the _Thousand Eyes Custom Metrics_ coming from the different Cloud Agents deployed around the world.
